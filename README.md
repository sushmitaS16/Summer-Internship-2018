# TRIBE-CodeForAnalysis

The workflow of my project during the summers of 2018, which involved running of the TRIBE pipeline (https://github.com/rosbashlab/TRIBE) and obtaining similar sort of result for my RBP, i.e. RNA-binding protein of interest. 
After the results were obtained, I had to analyze them using the R language. This repo consists of the code that I used during my analysis.
